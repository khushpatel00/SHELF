# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Library Management CRUD

The boilerplate has been extended with a simple library management system backed by `localStorage` and Redux.

### Features
- Add books (`/add`)
- View list of books (`/`)
- Inspect a single book with edit/delete (`/book/:id`)
- Edit an existing book (`/edit/:id`)
- Data persisted in browser `localStorage`

### Quick start
1. Install new dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/data/Code/SHELF
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Visit `http://localhost:5173` and interact with the library.

### Code structure
- `src/Logic` contains the Redux store, slices and helpers for persistence.
- `src/Components` has the React components for each page (`addBook`, `viewBooks`, `viewBook`, `editBook`).

> The system uses a simple `id` generated via `Date.now()`; you can swap in `uuid` if needed.

Happy hacking!
